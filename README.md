#This project uses the TVMaze.com's Open API to fetch & display the data in the form of listing cards (using Tailwind CSS) inside a Dashboard component. The listing cards won't be visible to users who are not logged in.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) & uses Tailwind CSS for UI styles & Axios to fetch the data from the API & show that on the frontend.
